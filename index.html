    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Arturo Villalobos and I am a senior Computing major
        @ Texas A&M University. I like skating, hiking, and graphic design. I am
        a huge font nerd and always looking for just the right .otf file
        (druk-wide is the best!). I am in the middle of a minor in statistics
        and I am super into data visualization, AI, ML, and data science. After
        this past summer I am also very interested in getting into freelance
        work, feel free to email, dm and otherwise message me using the links
        below!

    <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        I have been really interested in machine learning, artificial
        intelligence, and data visualization. These areas are at the cross
        section of statistics, math, and computer science and is one of the main
        reasons why I decided to get my minor in statistics as well and gear my
        undergraduate focus towards topics like ML and AI. I find it fascinating
        that we can recognize, predict, and interpret things in the real world
        through statistical methods and algorithms. I am also equally as
        concerned about the ethical issues that are inherent to AI and ML when
        talking about things like marketing, medicine, and law enforcement. In
        my experience there has not been enough emphasis put into topics like
        ethics and philosophy throughout my undergraduate. Computer science and
        philosophy is an area of study I plan to explore more in my pursuit of a
        masters degree.
